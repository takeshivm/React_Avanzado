# Notificaciones push

## 1. Instalamos web push global y generamos las vapid keys
npm install web-push -g
web-push generate-vapid-keys [--json]
-> Las keys se guardaran en el archivo serviceWorkerRegistration.js

## 2. Guardamos las keys en ServiceWorkerRegistration
A partir de la linea 21

## 3. Modificamos register() en el ServiceWorkerRegistration.js
EN la linea 60

## 4. Probamos que se puedan habilitar los permisos -> Los habilitamos


## 5. Creamos la primera notificación push automática, cada vez que haya una versión disponible
##      self.registration.showNotificacion(title, { body })
Lo copiamos dentro del service-worker, en la parte de los listeners
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 6. Creamos el servidor express.
Creamos el directorio "server", luego ingresamos, y en la consola: npm init
*npm i express cors (Cors para las llamadas interservidores)

# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
